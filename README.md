A tool that simulates an NBA player's stat line (points, rebounds, and assists) against specific opponents, and a sports betting tracker that helps you manage and visualize your betting history. I use this model to get a general overview on how I would expect a player's performance before further analyzing based on position matchups, recent trends, injuries/rests, and game script.

Model introduction:

This model takes an NBA player's P/R/A (points, rebounds, assists) line and applies an adjustment factor against their opponent's defensive metrics compared to league average.

Model limitations:

This model is limited to team-wide defensive metrics and individual offensive performance. It does not consider how effectively teams defend specific positions or how players perform against various defensive schemes. It also does not take into account in-season adjustments such as player trades, coaching changes, etc.

Areas for improvement:

Add an adjustment factor based on how effective teams are at defending certain positions. Finding a rate on how frequently a team employs a certain defensive scheme, and figuring out how well the player plays against such scheme would greatly improve model accuracy.
